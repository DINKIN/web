The Procd System Manager
========================

== Procd

_LEDE_ uses 'procd' for booting the system, managing processes and handling parts of the kernel/userland interaction. It can be considered similar to 'systemd' on full blown distributions. Here is a list of tasks that procd will do for us

* provide the pid 1 init service / preinit
* watchdog
* inittab
* init.d
* hotplug
* service startup / monitoring
* (configuration-)triggers

*WIP*
