The UCI Configuration System
============================

== UCI - Unified Configuration Interface

_LEDE_ uses UCI to store its configuration. This is a human readable file format using typed and named sections. Each section contains a number of options. Options can be single values or lists of values. All configuration files are stored in the /etc/config/ folder. You can manually edit these files.

----
root@lede:/# cat etc/config/system
config system
	option hostname	lede
	option timezone	UTC

config timeserver ntp
	list server	0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
	list server	1.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
	list server	2.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
	list server	3.openwrt.pool.ntp.org
	option enabled 1
	option enable_server 0

Alternatively you may use the uci CLI to read/modify their content. Using the CLI has the advantage that you do not need to worry about the validity of the syntax. Some users do however prefer to make changes manually, they should be aware that even minor syntax errors will make the whole file unparsable and not just the specific section and/or option that was modified.

----
root@lede:/# uci show system
system.@system[0]=system
system.@system[0].hostname='lede'
system.@system[0].timezone='UTC'
system.ntp=timeserver
system.ntp.server='0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org' '1.openwrt.pool.ntp.org' '2.openwrt.pool.ntp.org' '3.openwrt.pool.ntp.org'
system.ntp.enabled='1'
system.ntp.enable_server='0'
----

When using the CLI to modify values, you will find that all changes first get staged and not commited to the file directly. If you want to permanently store changes you need to commit them. After calling the commit command, you can also make the system reload and apply the changes that you made.  (This will only affect services that correctly use link:procd.html[procd] init scripts)

----
root@lede:/# uci set system.@system[0].hostname=foo
root@lede:/# uci commit
root@lede:/# reload_config
root@lede:/#
