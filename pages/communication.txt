=====================

== Communication

It is possible to communicate with other community members using mail and IRC.
All project related communication should be done on public channels that are
archived and easily browsable. Specific problems and tasks may be resolved
using direct means of communication.


=== Mailing Lists

The project offers the following mailing lists

. http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev[lede-dev@lists.infradead.org] -
  This list is used for submitting patches and general development related work
. http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-adm[lede-adm@lists.infradead.org] - 
  This list is used for project organisational purposes. Anyone can
  subscribe and read this list, only committers may write to this list.


=== IRC Channels

The project provides 2 IRC channels on freenode

. #lede-dev - a public channel for everyone to join and participate
. #lede-adm - a moderated channel that anyone can join but only people with +v flag can write on


=== Twitter

In case of services going down, being moved or being unreachable for any other
reason, please go to twitter and see what the status is. The project will do
its best to post updates link:https://twitter.com/lede_project[here]


=== Corporate Contact

There is a special email address that companies wanting to collaborate with the
project can use to contact committers confidentially. These types of "first contact"
only have the purpose of helping companies understand the mode of operations. Once the
intent is communicated, companies are invited to participate in the project just
like any other community member. This means that engagement should be done in
public. Ideally companies simply allow part of their R&D team to participate
in the normal development process as normal community members. There will be
no special treatment beyond the "first contact". Please see the project
link:rules.html[rules] for further information.

== Project Meetings

We attempt to have regular IRC meetings to discuss and decide project matters.
