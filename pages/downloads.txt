== Snapshot builds

The current master branch is regularly processed by a buildbot setup and the
resulting images can be found on https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/

=== Mirrors

The contents of the download server are available on several mirrors as well.
Please refer to the list below for alternative locations.

. Germany: [http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/lede/[HTTP]] [ftp://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/lede/[FTP]] [link:rsync://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/lede/[RSYNC]]
. Romania: [http://mirrors.linux.ro/lede/[HTTP]] [ftp://mirrors.linux.ro/lede/[FTP]]
. France: [http://lede-project.tetaneutral.net/[HTTP]] [link:rsync://lede-project.tetaneutral.net/downloads/[RSYNC]]

We'd like to thank the following sponsors for providing mirroring:
http://www.rcs-rds.ro[RCS&RDS], http://tetaneutral.net/[tetaneutral.net],
http://www.rwth-aachen.de/[RWTH Aachen].

=== How to mirror

Please use `rsync://downloads.lede-project.org/downloads` to obtain a copy of
the download repository.

Syncing the downloads share every 12 to 24 hours hours is ideal. Once a mirror
has been set up, feel free to announce it at `lede-adm@lists.lede-project.org`
so that it can be published on this page.

The data volume of the snapshots is roughly 35GB, we expect it to grow by
30-40GB with each release. Due to current bandwidth constraints we kindly ask
you to use something like `rsync --bwlimit 8000` when initially pulling the
data.

=== Sources

Any source code archives fetched by the buildbots during the build process are
available at http://sources.lede-project.org/
