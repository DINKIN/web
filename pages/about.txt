The name _LEDE_ is an abbreviation for Linux Embedded Development Environment,
a reference to its flexibility and embedded buildroot origins, making it a

and network appliance realm.

_LEDE_ is also an alternation of the phrase _to lead_, describing
an introductory section of a news story that is intended to entice the reader
to read the full story.
