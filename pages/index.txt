== About

The LEDE project was founded in April 2016 as an OpenWrt based spin off with a
strong focus on transparency, user collaboration and decentralised structures.

For a long time the OpenWrt parent project experienced infrastructure issues
and declining developer participation on the base system while the community
driven package ecosystem around it continued to thrive. When the number of
frequently active committers reached a new low in the beginning of 2016, some
OpenWrt developers decided to start a new spin-off project in an attempt to
change the development processes from the ground up and reboot the project in
a new, community-driven way.

=== Goals

LEDE's stated goals are:

. Building a great embedded distribution with focus on stability and
  functionality.
. Having regular, predictable release cycles coupled with better testing
  procedures.
. Establishing transparent decision processes with broad community
  participation and public meetings.

=== Name

image:logo/logo.png["The LEDE logo",role="left"]
The name _LEDE_ is an abbreviation for Linux Embedded Development Environment,
a reference to its flexibility and embedded buildroot origins, making it a
solid choice for embedded Linux applications far beyond the wireless router
and network appliance realm.

_LEDE_ is also an alternation of the phrase _to lead_, describing
an introductory section of a news story that is intended to entice the reader
to read the full story.

=== Endorsement

The *Wrt community is made up of many great communities all tinkering on their
own mission in improving something on this planet. the Following communities have
kindly decided to endorse our project. Thanks !

. none so far :-)
